Introduction                                                           *firvish*


This plugin is heavily inspired by [vim-dirvish](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-dirvish).

firvish.nvim is a buffer centric job control plugin. It provides mappings for handling buffer list, history, neovim and external commands. The output of these commands can be streamed to a dedicated buffer and/or an errorlist (e.g. a quickfix list or location list).

The main goal of firvish.nvim is to provide a single way of interacting with external commands, and internal commands of NeoVim through the use of buffers. They are used to interact with the output of commands, and the input is sent to external commands to interactively communicate with them.

See the documentation for more details.

Features                                                      *firvish.features*

Firvish is split into features, which can enabled on an individual basis and correspond to user
commands. Firvish does NOT create keymappings except in Firvish specific buffers (e.g. |firvish-buffers|).

These are the currently available features:
  * buffers - creates a |:Buffers| command which opens the buffer list
  * fh - creates several commands (|:Fhdo|, |:Fhfilter|, |:Fhq| and |:Fhl|) which allow you to
    interact with a buffer displaying files (see: |firvish-dir|)
  * find - creates three commands (|:Fd|, |:Cfd| and |:Lfd|) that captures the output of running
    `fd` in a dedicated buffer (see: |firvish-dir|), the quickfix list or the location list
    respectively. Requires `fd` (https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) to be installed
  * frun - creates three commands (|:Frun|, |:Cfrun| and |:Lfrun|) that captures the output of an
    arbitrary command in a dedicate buffer (see: |firvish-job|), the quickfix list or the location
    list respectively
  * grep - creates three commands (|:Rg|, |:Crg| and |:Lrg|) that captures the output of running
    `rg` in a dedicated buffer (see: |firvish-dir|), the quickfix list or the location list
    respectively. Requires `rg` (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to be installed
  * history - creates a |:History| command which shows recently opened files in a dedicated
    buffer (see: |firvish-dir|)
  * jobs - creates a |:FirvishJobs| command which shows jobs started via Firvish's job_control module.

Features can be enabled or disabled individually through |firvish.setup|:

>
require("firvish").setup {
  features = {
    buffers = true,  -- Enables the "buffer" feature
    history = false, -- Disables the "history" feature
  },
}
<

You can also enable all features:

>
require("firvish").setup {
  features = true,
}
<


firvish.setup()                                                  *firvish.setup*

    See: ~
        |firvish.config|


==============================================================================
Configuration                                                   *firvish.config*

firvish.nvim is split up into "features". See |firvish.features| for an exhaustive list.

==============================================================================
:Buffers                                              *firvish.features.buffers*

                                                                      *:Buffers*
The `:Buffers` command opens the buffer list.

How the `:Buffers` command opens the buffer list can be customized through |firvish.setup|:

>
require("firvish").setup {
  features = {
    buffers = {
      open = "edit",        -- Corresponds to |:edit|
      bang_open = "vsplit", -- Corresponds to |:vsplit|
    },
  },
}
<


                                                               *firvish-buffers*
The buffer list comes with some default keymaps.
You can add your own keymaps or change the default keymaps by specifying
them when calling |firvish.setup|. To disable a keymap, map it to `false`.

require("firvish").setup {
    features = {
        buffers = {
            keymaps = {
                n = {
